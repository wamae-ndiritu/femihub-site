            Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is used by HIV negative people after
            a possible exposure to HIV and should be started within 72 hours of
            exposure. PEP is for emergency situations. If taken 72 hours after
            possible exposure, PEP is highly effective in preventing HIV. PEP is
            safe but may cause side effects like nausea in some people.

            If you find yourself taking PEP regularly or believe yourself to be
            regularly exposed to HIV then you should start taking PrEP instead.
            PrEP is taken before exposure by HIV negative people who are at risk
            of acquiring HIV. PrEP reduces your chances of being infected with
            HIV.

                PEP are ARV's that may be used to prevent HIV infection in a
                person exposed to HIV within 72 hours. You must take PEP within
                72 hours of exposure for it to work optimally.

                A HIV test is done prior to initiating PEP, 28 days after taking
                the first PEP dose and 3 months after the initial HIV exposure.
                PEP will not protect you from unplanned pregnancy of other STIs.

            Quick guide to starting PEP
          </h2>
          <p>
            For PEP to work, it must be taken within 72 hours of exposure. The
            sooner you start it the better, every minute counts. You must test
            HIV negative to start PEP. You need to take PEP daily dose for 28
            days. It is given in a pill format. Missing doses of PEP can make
            the treatment less effective. It may be helpful to set a daily
            reminder to remember the time for your dose.

            What is a PEP Assessment Like
          </h2>
          <p>
            Exposure to HIV Is an emergency because HIV establishes infection
            very quickly. A health care worker will evaluate you rapidly for PEP
            initiation when care is sought within 72 hours after potential
            exposure. A HIV test will be done and once confirmed negative PEP
            will be prescribed.

            If you have been exposed to HIV infection for instance through a
            burst or broken condom, unprotected sex from a person with a
            positive or unknown HIV status, you will need to test negative for
            HIV to be eligible for PEP. It is important to check that you did
            not have infection before this risk. There are lots of HIV
            Self-Tests (HIVSTs) in the market. MyFemiHub offers two tests for
            clients onboard onto PrEP - Mylan and Sure Check. Only Mylan can be
            used onboard through MyFemiHub because of the uniqueness of the
            online onboarding journey.

          <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold my-4'>PrEP after PEP</h2>
          <p>
            If you are continously engaging in behaviour that exposes you to
            contracting HIV or you frequently need PEP, you should consider PrEP
            to protect yourself. After you have finished your 28 day course of
            PEP, and test again for HIV, if you are negative you should book a
            consultation to talk with one of MyFemiHub's Clinical Officers about
            PrEP to protect yourself long-term from HIV infection. Taking PrEP
            will enable you to continue to live your life as you are while
            keeping yourself and your relationships HIV free.
