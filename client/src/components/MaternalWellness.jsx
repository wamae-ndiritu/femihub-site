                Through antenatal care (ANC) we will help both you and your
                unborn baby stay healthy. Even if your pregnancy is going well
                and you’re feeling well, it’s important for you to attend your
                ANC appointments so that any potential risks can be identified
                and prevented, or reduced. During ANC you will have an
                opportunity to ask any questions you have about your pregnancy
                such as what's happening during each trimester, physical
                pregnancy symptoms and the birth itself and also about caring
                for your baby after the birth.

                effective PNC helps in recognizing any deviation from expected
                recovery after birth the health of the baby allowing prompt
                intervention if needed.
